## About
I am a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Chemistry, Boston University (MA, USA). I am actively looking for the role as a data scientist to apply cutting edge methods to understand massive data and improve its impact on society. My doctoral research experience has equipped me with versatile skill sets:
- Extensive knowledge in using Python / Matlab / R programming language for data processing and machine learning for their applications in materials science.
- Leadership: Lead three projects hosted by two national laboratories;
- Communication skills: Coordinate the progress with cross-team and international collaborations and report to the principal investigator and head scientists periodically;
- Presentation skills: Present to the professionals and public from less than 100 parties to ~ 500 people;
- Raising funding support from internal and external agencies.
- Data-driven thinking and complex data processing
- Productive performance: 4 journal articles have been released and 4 manuscripts are under preparation during Ph.D. training
